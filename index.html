            <p>I grew up in a small mid-Michigan farm town.<br>
            Both my parents were public school teachers.<br>
            I loved to read and explore the forest around our house.<br>
            We didn't use a lot of technology.</p>

        <p>I grew into a teenager who loved to make things.<br>
        I made music with a lot of different instruments.<br>
        I wrote stories which seemed a lot better at the time.</p>

        <p>When I was a month away from graduating, some friends in engineering went to a one-day coding workshop. I tagged along.<br>
        I loved it so much that I decided I wanted to do it more.<br>
        I dug into Harvard's CS50. I worked through FreeCodeCamp.<br>
        I decided I wanted to build things with code as a career, but I couldn't afford another four year degree.</p>

        <p>I wanted structure and guidance, because the world of technology was fairly new to me.<br>
        I did some research and decided to go to Lambda School, which is an full-time 8 month technical academy somewhere between a bootcamp and a formal education.<br>
        In my first three months of Lambda, I did these things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comprehensive implementation of modern JavaScript environments and tooling (ES6+)</li>
            <li>Detailed study and implementation of data structures and algorithms</li>
            <li>Implement responsive web pages with semantic HTML5 & modern CSS3 (such as flexbox)</li>
            <li>Develop Single Page Applications (SPAs) with ES6+, React, Redux, and webpack</li>
            <li>Build various backend RESTful APIs backed by NoSQL and relational databases (MongoDB, MySQL)</li>
            <li>Implement authentication workflows using stateless JWTs, cookie-based systems, and third-party OAuth providers</li>
            <li>Test both front-end and back-end JavaScript applications with tooling such as Jest</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After I finished the first three months, I applied to be a Project Manager for the incoming class of students so that I could gain leadership experience and solidify my knowledge of the material.<br>
       Instead, I ended up as Section Lead, a full-time role I'm currently working in. On a daily basis, I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversee 18 Project Managers and 129 students</li>
            <li>Audit code reviews to ensure quality feedback is provided to students</li>
            <li>Work closely with instructors to improve curriculum and lessons</li>
            <li>Lead daily stand-ups for Project Managers</li>
            <li>Identify and organizing support for struggling students</li>
            <li>Work with students and Project Managers to evaluate and debug code on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Continue side projects so that I keep progressing in my abilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I get to read lots of code every day, and after work I write my own, build things I enjoy, and learn about new technologies.<br>
        I will be in this role until April 19th. After that, I'll start on my Lambda Internship where I'll work with a small team to create a market-ready product.<br>
        After my internship, I'll dive into the CS curriculum, where I'll study things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Django</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I love being with Lambda, but I'm also excited start working a team. For now, you can check out some of my projects below.</p>
