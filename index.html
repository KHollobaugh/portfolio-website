        <p>I grew up in a small mid-Michigan farm town.</p>
        <p>Both my parents were public school teachers.</p>
        <p>I loved to read and explore the forest around our house.</p>
        <p>We didn't use a lot of technology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "story-section-2">
        <p>I grew into a teenager who loved to make things.</p>
        <p>I made music with a lot of different instruments.</p>
        <p>I wrote stories which seemed a lot better at the time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "story-section-3">
        <p>I went to these universities</p>
        <h3>University of Michigan</h3>
        <h3>Michigan State University</h3>
        <p>(which, despite the names, are actually different places)</p>
        <p>where I learned Arabic and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</p>
        <p>and worked as a line-cook.</p>
        <p>I thought a lot about doing homework and paying rent, and didn't think much further into my future than that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "story-section-4">
        <p>When I was a month away from graduating, some friends in engineering went to a one-day coding workshop. I tagged along.</p>
        <p>I loved it so much that I decided I wanted to do it more.</p>
        <p>I dug into Harvard's CS50. I worked through FreeCodeCamp.</p>
        <p>I decided I wanted to build things with code as a career, but I couldn't afford another four year degree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "story-section-5">
        <p>I wanted structure and guidance, because the world of technology was fairly new to me.</p>
        <p>I did some research and decided to go to Lambda School, which is an full-time 8 month technical academy somewhere between a bootcamp and a formal education.</p>
        <p>In my first three months of Lambda, I did these things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comprehensive implementation of modern JavaScript environments and tooling (ES6+)</li>
            <li>Detailed study and implementation of data structures and algorithms</li>
            <li>Implement responsive web pages with semantic HTML5 & modern CSS3 (such as flexbox)</li>
            <li>Develop Single Page Applications (SPAs) with ES6+, React, Redux, and webpack</li>
            <li>Build various backend RESTful APIs backed by NoSQL and relational databases (MongoDB, MySQL)</li>
            <li>Implement authentication workflows using stateless JWTs, cookie-based systems, and third-party OAuth providers</li>
            <li>Test both front-end and back-end JavaScript applications with tooling such as Jest</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After I finished the first three months, I applied to be a Project Manager for the incoming class of students so that I could gain leadership experience and solidify my knowledge of the material.</p>
        <p>Instead, I ended up as Section Lead, a full-time role I'm currently working in. On a daily basis, I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversee 18 Project Managers and 129 students</li>
            <li>Audit code reviews to ensure quality feedback is provided to students</li>
            <li>Work closely with instructors to improve curriculum and lessons</li>
            <li>Lead daily stand-ups for Project Managers</li>
            <li>Identify and organizing support for struggling students</li>
            <li>Work with students and Project Managers to evaluate and debug code on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Continue side projects so that I keep progressing in my abilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I get to read lots of code every day, and after work I write my own, build things I enjoy, and learn about new technologies.</p>
        <p>I will be in this role until April 19th. After that, I'll start on my Lambda Internship where I'll work with a small team to create a market-ready product.</p>
        <p>After my internship, I'll dive into the CS curriculum, where I'll study things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Django</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I love being with Lambda, but I'm also excited start working a team. For now, you can check out some of my projects below.</p>
